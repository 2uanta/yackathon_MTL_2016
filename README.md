# Yelp hackathon (Yackathon) Montreal 2016

R code developed during the Yackathon Montreal 2016.

It was a good opportunity to practice with these libraries. The code contains good working sample of using these libraries:

* library(RCurl)
* library(RJSONIO)
* library(TTR)
* library(gender)
* library(geosphere)
* library(rattle)
* library(tm)
* library(wordcloud)
* library(zoo)
